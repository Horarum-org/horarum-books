^5^ For you have accomplished my judgment and my cause. You have sat upon the throne that judges justice.

^6^ You have rebuked the Gentiles, and the impious one has perished. You have deleted their name in eternity and for all generations.

[[psalms-9-7]]
^7^ The spears of the enemy have failed in the end, and their cities, you have destroyed. Their memory has perished with a loud noise.

[[psalms-9-8]]

[[psalms-9-9]]
^9^ And he will judge the whole world in equity. He will judge the people in justice.

[[psalms-9-10]]

^11^ And may they hope in you, who know your name. For you have not abandoned those seeking you, Lord.

[[psalms-9-12]]
^12^ Sing a psalm to the Lord, who dwells in Zion. Announce his study among the Gentiles.

^15^ You lift me up from the gates of death, so that I may announce all your praises at the gates of the daughter of Zion.

^19^ For the poor will not be forgotten in the end. The patience of the poor will not perish in the end.

^21^ O Lord, establish a lawgiver over them, so that the Gentiles may know that they are only men.


[[psalms-9-22]]
^22^ So then, why, O Lord, have you withdrawn far away? Why have you overlooked us in opportunity, in tribulation?

[[psalms-9-23]]
^23^ While the impious is arrogant, the poor is enflamed. They are held by the counsels that they devise.

[[psalms-9-24]]
^24^ For the sinner is praised by the desires of his soul, and the iniquitous is blessed.

[[psalms-9-25]]
^25^ The sinner has provoked the Lord; according to the multitude of his wrath, he will not seek him.

[[psalms-9-26]]
^26^ God is not before his sight. His ways are stained at all times. Your judgments are removed from his face. He will be master of all his enemies.

[[psalms-9-27]]
^27^ For he has said in his heart, “I will not be disturbed: from generation to generation without evil.”

[[psalms-9-28]]
^28^ His mouth is full of curses, and bitterness, and deceit. Under his tongue are hardship and sorrow.

[[psalms-9-29]]
^29^ He sits in ambush, with resources in hidden places, so that he may execute the innocent.

[[psalms-9-30]]
^30^ His eyes catch sight of the poor. He lies in ambush, in hiding like a lion in his den. He lies in ambush, so that he may seize the poor, to seize the poor as he draws him in.

[[psalms-9-31]]
^31^ With his snare, he will bring him down. He will crouch down and pounce, when he has power over the poor.

[[psalms-9-32]]
^32^ For he has said in his heart, “God has forgotten, he has turned away his face, lest he see to the end.”

[[psalms-9-33]]
^33^ O Lord God, rise up. Let your hand be exalted. Do not forget the poor.

[[psalms-9-34]]
^34^ How has the impious one provoked God? For he has said in his heart, “He will not inquire.”

[[psalms-9-35]]
^35^ You do see, for you examine hardship and sorrow, so that you may deliver them into your hands. The poor one has been abandoned to you. You will be a helper to the orphan.

[[psalms-9-36]]
^36^ Break the arm of the sinner and the malicious. His sin will be sought, and it will not be found.

[[psalms-9-37]]
^37^ The Lord shall reign in eternity, even forever and ever. You will perish the Gentiles from his land.

[[psalms-9-38]]
^38^ The Lord has heeded the desire of the poor. Your ear has listened to the preparation of their heart,

[[psalms-9-39]]
^39^ so as to judge for the orphan and the humble, so that man may no longer presume to magnify himself upon the earth.

[[psalms-10-4]]
^4^ For they have destroyed the things that you have completed. But what has the just one done?

[[psalms-10-5]]
^5^ The Lord is in his holy temple. The Lord’s throne is in heaven. His eyes look upon the poor. His eyelids question the sons of men.

[[psalms-10-6]]
^6^ The Lord questions the just and the impious. Yet he who loves iniquity, hates his own soul.

[[psalms-10-7]]
^7^ He will rain down snares upon sinners. Fire and brimstone and windstorms will be the portion of their cup.

[[psalms-10-8]]

[[psalms-11-4]]
^4^ May the Lord scatter all deceitful lips, along with the tongue that speaks malice.

[[psalms-11-5]]
^5^ They have said: “We will magnify our tongue; our lips belong to us. Who is our Lord?”

[[psalms-11-6]]

[[psalms-11-8]]

[[psalms-12-3]]
^3^ How long will my enemy be exalted over me?

[[psalms-12-4]]
^4^ Look upon me and listen to me, O Lord my God. Enlighten my eyes, lest I fall asleep forever in death,

[[psalms-12-5]]
^5^ lest at any time my enemy may say, “I have prevailed against him.” Those who trouble me will exult, if I have been disturbed.

[[psalms-12-6]]

== Chapter 13
 (14)
[[psalms-13-1]]
^1^ Unto the end. A Psalm of David. The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” They were corrupted, and they have become abominable in their studies. There is no one who does good; there is not even one.

[[psalms-13-2]]
^2^ The Lord has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any who were considering or seeking God.

[[psalms-13-3]]
^3^ They have all gone astray; together they have become useless. There is no one who does good; there is not even one.

[[psalms-13-4]]
^4^ Their throat is an open sepulcher. With their tongues, they have been acting deceitfully; the venom of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.

[[psalms-13-5]]
^5^ Their feet are swift to shed blood. Grief and unhappiness are in their ways; and the way of peace, they have not known.

[[psalms-13-6]]

[[psalms-13-7]]
^7^ Will they never learn: all those who work iniquity, who devour my people like a meal of bread?

[[psalms-13-8]]

[[psalms-13-10]]

^3^ As for the saints, who are in his land: he has made all my desires wonderful in them.

[[psalms-15-4]]
^4^ Their infirmities have been multiplied; after this, they acted more quickly. I will not gather for their convocations of blood, nor will I remember their names with my lips.

[[psalms-15-5]]
^5^ The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and my cup. It is you who will restore my inheritance to me.

[[psalms-15-6]]
^6^ The lots have fallen upon me with clarity. And, indeed, my inheritance has been very clear to me.

[[psalms-15-8]]

[[psalms-15-10]]
^10^ For you will not abandon my soul to Hell, nor will you allow your holy one to see corruption.

[[psalms-15-11]]

[[psalms-16-1]]
^1^ A Prayer of David. Lord, listen to my justice, attend to my supplication. Pay attention to my prayer, which is not from deceitful lips.

[[psalms-16-2]]
^2^ Let my judgment proceed from your presence. Let your eyes behold fairness.

[[psalms-16-3]]
^3^ You have tested my heart and visited it by night. You have examined me by fire, and iniquity has not been found in me.

[[psalms-16-4]]
^4^ Therefore, may my mouth not speak the works of men. I have kept to difficult ways because of the words of your lips.

[[psalms-16-5]]
^5^ Perfect my steps in your paths, so that my footsteps may not be disturbed.

[[psalms-16-6]]
^6^ I have cried out because you, O God, have listened to me. Incline your ear to me and heed my words.

[[psalms-16-7]]
^7^ Make your mercies wonderful, for you save those who hope in you.

[[psalms-16-8]]
^8^ From those who resist your right hand, preserve me like the pupil of your eye. Protect me under the shadow of your wings,

[[psalms-16-9]]
^9^ from the face of the impious who have afflicted me. My enemies have surrounded my soul.

[[psalms-16-10]]
^10^ They have concealed their fatness; their mouth has been speaking arrogantly.

[[psalms-16-11]]
^11^ They have cast me out, and now they have surrounded me. They have cast their eyes down to the earth.

[[psalms-16-12]]
^12^ They have taken me, like a lion ready for the prey, and like a young lion dwelling in hiding.

[[psalms-16-13]]
^13^ Rise up, O Lord, arrive before him and displace him. Deliver my soul from the impious one: your spear from the enemies of your hand.

[[psalms-16-14]]
^14^ Lord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life. Their gut has been filled from your hidden stores. They have been filled with sons, and they have bequeathed to their little ones the remainder.

[[psalms-16-15]]
^15^ But as for me, I will appear before your sight in justice. I will be satisfied when your glory appears.

[[psalms-29-7]]
^7^ But I have said in my abundance: “I will never be disturbed.”

^9^ To you, Lord, I will cry out. And I will make supplication to my God.

[[psalms-29-10]]

^8^ I will exult and rejoice in your mercy. For you have looked upon my humility; you have saved my soul from needfulness.

[[psalms-30-9]]
^9^ And you have not enclosed me in the hands of the enemy. You have set my feet in a spacious place.

[[psalms-30-10]]
^10^ Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am troubled. My eye has been disturbed by wrath, along with my soul and my gut.

[[psalms-30-11]]

[[psalms-30-12]]
^12^ I have become a disgrace among all my enemies, and even more so to my neighbors, and a dread to my acquaintances. Those who catch sight of me, flee away from me.

[[psalms-30-13]]
^13^ I have become forgotten, like one dead to the heart. I have become like a damaged utensil.

[[psalms-30-14]]
^14^ For I have heard the harsh criticism of many who linger in the area. While assembled together against me in that place, they deliberated on how to take away my life.

[[psalms-30-16]]

[[psalms-30-19]]
^19^ May deceitful lips be silenced: those that speak iniquity against the just, in arrogance and in abusiveness.

[[psalms-30-20]]
^20^ How great is the multitude of your sweetness, O Lord, which you keep hidden for those who fear you, which you have perfected for those who hope in you, in the sight of the sons of men.

[[psalms-30-21]]
^21^ You hide them in the concealment of your face, from the disturbance of men. You protect them in your tabernacle, from the contradiction of tongues.

[[psalms-30-22]]
^22^ Blessed is the Lord. For he has shown his wonderful mercy to me, in a fortified city.

[[psalms-30-23]]
^23^ But I said in the excess of my mind: “I have been cast away from the glance of your eyes.” And so, you heeded the voice of my prayer, while I was still crying out to you.

[[psalms-30-24]]
^24^ Love the Lord, all you his saints. For the Lord will require truth, and he will abundantly repay those who act with arrogance.

^4^ For, day and night, your hand was heavy upon me. I have been converted in my anguish, while still the thorn is piercing.

[[psalms-31-5]]

[[psalms-31-6]]
^6^ For this, everyone who is holy will pray to you in due time. Yet truly, in a flood of many waters, they will not draw near to him.

[[psalms-31-7]]
^7^ You are my refuge from the tribulation that has surrounded me. You are my exultation: rescue me from those who are surrounding me.

[[psalms-31-8]]

^16^ The king is not saved by great power, nor will the giant be saved by his many powers.

[[psalms-32-17]]
^17^ The horse is false safety; for he will not be saved by the abundance of his powers.

[[psalms-32-18]]
^18^ Behold, the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him and on those who hope in his mercy,

[[psalms-32-19]]
^19^ so as to rescue their souls from death and to feed them during famine.

[[psalms-32-20]]

[[psalms-34-6]]

[[psalms-34-10]]

[[psalms-34-11]]
^11^ Unfair witnesses have risen up, interrogating me about things of which I am ignorant.

[[psalms-34-12]]
^12^ They repaid me evil for good, to the deprivation of my soul.

[[psalms-34-13]]
^13^ But as for me, when they were harassing me, I was clothed with haircloth. I humbled my soul with fasting, and my prayer will become my sinews.

[[psalms-34-14]]
^14^ Like a neighbor, and like our brother, so did I please; like one mourning and contrite, so was I humbled.

[[psalms-34-15]]

[[psalms-34-16]]

[[psalms-35-4]]
^4^ The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit. He is unwilling to understand, so that he may act well.

[[psalms-35-5]]

[[psalms-35-6]]
^6^ Lord, your mercy is in heaven, and your truth is even to the clouds.

[[psalms-35-7]]

[[psalms-35-9]]

[[psalms-36-10]]
^10^ Yet still a little while, and the sinner will not be. And you will search his place and find nothing.

[[psalms-36-11]]
^11^ But the meek shall inherit the earth, and they will delight in the multitude of peace.

[[psalms-36-12]]
^12^ The sinner will observe the just, and he will gnash his teeth over him.

[[psalms-36-13]]
^13^ But the Lord will laugh at him: for he knows in advance that his day will come.

[[psalms-36-14]]
^14^ The sinners have drawn the sword, they have bent their bow, so as to cast down the poor and the needy, so as to massacre the upright of heart.

[[psalms-36-15]]
^15^ Let their sword enter into their own hearts, and let their bow be broken.

[[psalms-36-16]]
^16^ A little is better to the just than the many riches of sinners.

[[psalms-36-17]]
^17^ For the arms of sinners will be crushed, but the Lord confirms the just.

[[psalms-36-18]]
^18^ The Lord knows the days of the immaculate, and their inheritance will be in eternity.

[[psalms-36-19]]
^19^ They will not be confounded in an evil time; and in days of famine, they will be satisfied:

[[psalms-36-21]]
^21^ The sinner will lend and not release, but the just one shows compassion and donates.

^23^ The steps of a man will be directed by the Lord, and he will choose his way.

[[psalms-36-24]]
^24^ When he falls, he will not be harmed, because the Lord places his hand under him.

[[psalms-36-25]]
^25^ I have been young, and now I am old; and I have not seen the just forsaken, nor his offspring seeking bread.

[[psalms-36-26]]
^26^ He shows compassion and lends, all day long, and his offspring will be in blessing.

[[psalms-36-27]]
^27^ Turn away from evil and do good, and dwell forever and ever.

[[psalms-36-28]]
^28^ For the Lord loves judgment, and he will not abandon his saints. They will be kept safe in eternity. The unjust will be punished, and the offspring of the impious will perish.

[[psalms-36-29]]
^29^ But the just will inherit the earth, and they will dwell upon it forever and ever.

[[psalms-36-30]]
^30^ The mouth of the just one will express wisdom, and his tongue will speak judgment.

[[psalms-36-31]]
^31^ The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be supplanted.

[[psalms-36-32]]
^32^ The sinner considers the just one and seeks to put him to death.

^34^ Wait for the Lord, and keep to his way. And he will exalt you, so as to inherit the land that you may seize. When the sinners will have passed away, then you shall see.

[[psalms-36-35]]
^35^ I have seen the impious over-exalted, and lifted up like the cedars of Lebanon.

[[psalms-36-36]]
^36^ And I passed by, and behold, he was not. And I sought him, and his place was not found.

[[psalms-36-37]]
^37^ Keep to innocence, and gaze upon fairness: because there are allotments for the peaceful man.

[[psalms-36-38]]
^38^ But the unjust will be destroyed together: the allotments of the impious will pass away.

[[psalms-36-39]]
^39^ But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, and he is their protector in time of tribulation.

[[psalms-36-40]]

[[psalms-37-2]]
^2^ O Lord, do not rebuke me in your fury, nor chastise me in your wrath.

[[psalms-37-10]]
^10^ O Lord, all my desire is before you, and my groaning before you has not been hidden.

[[psalms-37-11]]
^11^ My heart has been disturbed. My strength has abandoned me, and the light of my eyes has abandoned me, and it is not with me.

[[psalms-37-12]]
^12^ My friends and my neighbors have drawn near and stood against me. And those who were next to me stood far apart. And those who sought my soul used violence.

[[psalms-37-13]]
^13^ And those who sought evil accusations against me were speaking emptiness. And they practiced deceitfulness all day long.

[[psalms-37-14]]
^14^ But, like someone deaf, I did not hear. And I was like someone mute, not opening his mouth.

[[psalms-37-15]]
^15^ And I became like a man who does not hear, and who has no reproofs in his mouth.

[[psalms-37-16]]
^16^ For in you, Lord, I have hoped. You will listen to me, O Lord my God.

[[psalms-37-17]]
^17^ For I said, “Lest at any time, my enemies might rejoice over me,” and, “While my feet are being shaken, they have spoken great things against me.”

[[psalms-37-18]]
^18^ For I have been prepared for scourges, and my sorrow is ever before me.

[[psalms-37-19]]
^19^ For I will announce my iniquity, and I will think about my sin.

[[psalms-37-20]]
^20^ But my enemies live, and they have been stronger than me. And those who have wrongfully hated me have been multiplied.

[[psalms-37-21]]
^21^ Those who render evil for good have dragged me down, because I followed goodness.

[[psalms-37-22]]
^22^ Do not forsake me, O Lord my God. Do not depart from me.

[[psalms-37-23]]
^23^ Be attentive to my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation.

^1^ Unto the end. For Jeduthun himself. A Canticle of David.

[[psalms-38-2]]
^2^ I said, “I will keep to my ways, so that I will not offend with my tongue.” I posted a guard at my mouth, when a sinner took up a position against me.

[[psalms-38-3]]
^3^ I was silenced and humbled, and I was quiet before good things, and my sorrow was renewed.

[[psalms-38-4]]
^4^ My heart grew hot within me, and, during my meditation, a fire would flare up.

[[psalms-38-5]]
^5^ I spoke with my tongue, “O Lord, make me know my end, and what the number of my days will be, so that I may know what is lacking to me.”

[[psalms-38-6]]
^6^ Behold, you have made my days measurable, and, before you, my substance is as nothing. Yet truly, all things are vanity: every living man.

[[psalms-38-7]]
^7^ So then, truly man passes by like an image; even so, he is disquieted in vain. He stores up, and he knows not for whom he will gather these things.

[[psalms-38-8]]
^8^ And now, what is it that awaits me? Is it not the Lord? And my substance is with you.

[[psalms-38-9]]
^9^ Rescue me from all my iniquities. You have handed me over as a reproach to the foolish.

[[psalms-38-10]]
^10^ I was silenced, and I did not open my mouth, because it was you who acted.

[[psalms-38-11]]
^11^ Remove your scourges from me.

[[psalms-38-12]]
^12^ I fall short at corrections from the strength of your hand. For you have chastised man for iniquity. And you have made his soul shrink away like a spider. Nevertheless, it is in vain that any man be disquieted.

[[psalms-38-13]]
^13^ O Lord, heed my prayer and my supplication. Pay attention to my tears. Do not be silent. For I am a newcomer with you, and a sojourner, just as all my fathers were.

[[psalms-38-14]]
^14^ Forgive me, so that I may be refreshed, before I will go forth and be no more.

[[psalms-39-2]]
^2^ I have waited expectantly for the Lord, and he was attentive to me.

[[psalms-39-3]]
^3^ And he heard my prayers and he led me out of the pit of misery and the quagmire. And he stationed my feet upon a rock, and he directed my steps.

[[psalms-39-4]]
^4^ And he sent a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God. Many will see, and they will fear; and they will hope in the Lord.

[[psalms-39-5]]
^5^ Blessed is the man whose hope is in the name of the Lord, and who has no respect for vanities and absurd falsehoods.

[[psalms-39-6]]
^6^ You have accomplished your many wonders, O Lord my God, and there is no one similar to you in your thoughts. I have announced and I have spoken: they are multiplied beyond number.

[[psalms-39-7]]
^7^ Sacrifice and oblation, you did not want. But you have perfected ears for me. Holocaust and sin offering, you did not require.

[[psalms-39-8]]
^8^ Then I said, “Behold, I draw near.” At the head of the book, it has been written of me:

[[psalms-39-9]]
^9^ that I should do your will. My God, I have willed it. And your law is in the midst of my heart.

[[psalms-39-10]]
^10^ I have announced your justice in a great Church: behold, I will not restrain my lips. O Lord, you have known it.

[[psalms-39-11]]
^11^ I have not concealed your justice within my heart. I have spoken your truth and your salvation. I have not concealed your mercy and your truth from a great assembly.

[[psalms-39-12]]
^12^ O Lord, do not take your tender mercies far from me. Your mercy and your truth ever sustain me.

[[psalms-39-13]]
^13^ For evils without number have surrounded me. My iniquities have taken hold of me, and I was not able to see. They have been multiplied beyond the hairs of my head. And my heart has forsaken me.

[[psalms-39-14]]
^14^ Be pleased, O Lord, to rescue me. Look down, O Lord, to help me.

[[psalms-39-15]]
^15^ Let them together be confounded and awed, who seek after my soul to steal it away. Let them be turned back and be in awe, who wish evils upon me.

[[psalms-39-16]]
^16^ Let them bear their confusion all at once, who say to me, “Well, well.”

[[psalms-39-17]]
^17^ Let all who seek you exult and rejoice over you. And let those who love your salvation always say, “May the Lord be magnified.”

[[psalms-39-18]]
^18^ But I am a beggar and poor. The Lord has been concerned about me. You are my helper and my protector. My God, do not delay.

[[psalms-40-2]]
^2^ Blessed is he who shows understanding toward the needy and the poor. The Lord will deliver him in the evil day.

[[psalms-40-3]]
^3^ May the Lord preserve him and give him life, and make him blessed upon the earth. And may he not hand him over to the will of his adversaries.

[[psalms-40-4]]
^4^ May the Lord bring him help on his bed of sorrow. In his infirmity, you have changed his entire covering.

[[psalms-40-5]]
^5^ I said, “O Lord, be merciful to me. Heal my soul, because I have sinned against you.”

[[psalms-40-6]]
^6^ My enemies have spoken evils against me. When will he die and his name perish?

[[psalms-40-7]]
^7^ And when he came in to see me, he was speaking emptiness. His heart gathered iniquity to itself. He went outside, and he was speaking in the same way.

[[psalms-40-8]]
^8^ All my enemies were whispering against me. They were thinking up evils against me.

[[psalms-40-9]]
^9^ They established an unjust word against me. Will he that sleeps no longer rise again?

[[psalms-40-10]]
^10^ For even the man of my peace, in whom I hoped, who ate my bread, has greatly supplanted me.

[[psalms-40-11]]
^11^ But you, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up again. And I will requite them.

[[psalms-40-12]]
^12^ By this, I knew that you preferred me: because my adversary will not rejoice over me.

[[psalms-40-13]]
^13^ But you have sustained me, because of my innocence, and you have confirmed me in your sight in eternity.

[[psalms-40-14]]
^14^ Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, for all generations and even forever. Amen. Amen.

[[psalms-41-4]]
^4^ My tears have been my bread, day and night. Meanwhile, it is said to me daily: “Where is your God?”

[[psalms-41-5]]

[[psalms-41-6]]
^6^ Why are you sad, my soul? And why do you disquiet me? Hope in God, for I will still confess to him: the salvation of my countenance,

[[psalms-41-10]]
^10^ I will say to God, “You are my supporter. Why have you forgotten me? And why do I walk in mourning, while my adversary afflicts me?”

[[psalms-41-11]]
^11^ While my bones are being broken, my enemies, who trouble me, have reproached me. Meanwhile, they say to me every single day, “Where is your God?”

[[psalms-41-12]]

[[psalms-42-3]]
^3^ Send forth your light and your truth. They have guided me and led me, to your holy mountain and into your tabernacles.

[[psalms-42-4]]
^4^ And I will enter, up to the altar of God, to God who enlivens my youthfulness. To you, O God, my God, I will confess upon a stringed instrument.

[[psalms-43-2]]
^2^ We have heard, O God, with our own ears. Our fathers have announced to us the work that you wrought in their days and in the days of antiquity.

[[psalms-43-3]]
^3^ Your hand dispersed the Gentiles, and you transplanted them. You afflicted a people, and you expelled them.

[[psalms-43-4]]
^4^ For they did not take possession of the land by their sword, and their own arm did not save them. But your right hand and your arm, and the light of your countenance did so, because you were pleased with them.

[[psalms-43-5]]
^5^ You yourself are my king and my God, who commands the salvation of Jacob.

[[psalms-43-6]]
^6^ With you, we will brandish a horn before our enemies; and in your name, we will spurn those rising up against us.

[[psalms-43-7]]
^7^ For I will not hope in my bow, and my sword will not save me.

[[psalms-43-8]]

[[psalms-43-9]]
^9^ In God, we will give praise all day long; and in your name, we will confess forever.

[[psalms-43-10]]

[[psalms-43-11]]
^11^ You have turned our back to our enemies, and those who hated us have plundered for themselves.

[[psalms-43-12]]
^12^ You have given us over like sheep for food. You have scattered us among the Gentiles.

[[psalms-43-13]]
^13^ You have sold your people without a price, and no great number was exchanged for them.

[[psalms-43-14]]
^14^ You have set us as a disgrace to our neighbors, a scoff and a derision to those who are around us.

[[psalms-43-15]]
^15^ You have set us as a parable among the Gentiles, a shaking of the head among the peoples.

[[psalms-43-16]]
^16^ All day long my shame is before me, and the confusion of my face has covered me,

[[psalms-43-17]]
^17^ before the voice of the reproacher and the commentator, before the face of the adversary and the pursuer.

[[psalms-43-18]]
^18^ All these things have come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you, and we have not acted unjustly in your covenant.

[[psalms-43-19]]
^19^ And our heart has not turned back. And you have not diverted our steps from your way.

[[psalms-43-20]]
^20^ For you humbled us in a place of affliction, and the shadow of death has covered us.

[[psalms-43-21]]
^21^ If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have extended our hands to a foreign god,

[[psalms-43-22]]
^22^ will not God find this out? For he knows the secrets of the heart. For, because of you, we are being killed all day long. We are considered as sheep for the slaughter.

[[psalms-43-23]]
^23^ Rise up. Why do you fall asleep, O Lord? Rise up, and do not reject us in the end.

[[psalms-43-24]]
^24^ Why do you turn your face away, and why do you forget our needfulness and our tribulation?

[[psalms-43-25]]
^25^ For our soul has been humbled into the dust. Our belly has been bound to the earth.

[[psalms-44-13]]
^13^ And the daughters of Tyre will entreat your countenance with gifts: all the rich men of the people.

[[psalms-44-14]]

^8^ no brother redeems, nor will man buy back. He will not give to God his appeasement,

[[psalms-48-10]]
^10^ and he will still live, until the end.

^11^ I know all the flying things of the air, and the beauty of the field is with me.

[[psalms-49-12]]
^12^ If I should be hungry, I would not tell you: for the whole world is mine, and all its plentitude.

[[psalms-49-13]]
^13^ Shall I gnaw on the flesh of bulls? Or would I drink the blood of goats?

[[psalms-49-14]]
^14^ Offer to God the sacrifice of praise, and pay your vows to the Most High.

[[psalms-49-15]]
^15^ And call upon me in the day of tribulation. I will rescue you, and you will honor me.

[[psalms-49-16]]
^16^ But to the sinner, God has said: Why do you discourse on my justices, and take up my covenant through your mouth?

[[psalms-49-17]]
^17^ Truly, you have hated discipline, and you have cast my sermons behind you.

[[psalms-49-18]]
^18^ If you saw a thief, you ran with him, and you have placed your portion with adulterers.

[[psalms-49-19]]
^19^ Your mouth has abounded with malice, and your tongue has concocted deceits.

[[psalms-49-20]]
^20^ Sitting, you spoke against your brother, and you set up a scandal against your mother’s son.

[[psalms-49-21]]
^21^ These things you have done, and I was silent. You thought, unjustly, that I ought to be like you. But I will reprove you, and I will set myself against your face.

[[psalms-49-22]]
^22^ Understand these things, you who forget God; lest at any time, he might quickly take you away, and there would be no one to rescue you.

[[psalms-49-23]]
^23^ The sacrifice of praise will honor me. And in that place is the journey by which I will reveal to him the salvation of God.

[[psalms-50-1]]
^1^ Unto the end. A Psalm of David,

[[psalms-50-2]]
^2^ when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he went to Bathsheba.

[[psalms-50-3]]
^3^ Be merciful to me, O God, according to your great mercy. And, according to the plentitude of your compassion, wipe out my iniquity.

[[psalms-50-4]]
^4^ Wash me once again from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

[[psalms-50-5]]
^5^ For I know my iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.

[[psalms-50-6]]
^6^ Against you only have I sinned, and I have done evil before your eyes. And so, you are justified in your words, and you will prevail when you give judgment.

[[psalms-50-7]]
^7^ For behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sinfulness did my mother conceive me.

[[psalms-50-8]]
^8^ For behold, you have loved truth. The obscure and hidden things of your wisdom, you have manifested to me.

[[psalms-50-9]]
^9^ You will sprinkle me with hyssop, and I will be cleansed. You will wash me, and I will be made whiter than snow.

[[psalms-50-10]]
^10^ In my hearing, you will grant gladness and rejoicing. And the bones that have been humbled will exult.

[[psalms-50-11]]
^11^ Turn your face away from my sins, and erase all my iniquities.

[[psalms-50-12]]
^12^ Create a clean heart in me, O God. And renew an upright spirit within my inmost being.

[[psalms-50-13]]
^13^ Do not cast me away from your face; and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.

[[psalms-50-14]]
^14^ Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and confirm me with an unsurpassed spirit.

[[psalms-50-15]]
^15^ I will teach the unjust your ways, and the impious will be converted to you.

[[psalms-50-16]]
^16^ Free me from blood, O God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue will extol your justice.

[[psalms-50-17]]
^17^ O Lord, you will open my lips, and my mouth will announce your praise.

[[psalms-50-18]]
^18^ For if you had desired sacrifice, I would certainly have given it, but with holocausts, you will not be delighted.

[[psalms-50-19]]
^19^ A crushed spirit is a sacrifice to God. A contrite and humbled heart, O God, you will not spurn.

[[psalms-50-20]]
^20^ Act kindly, Lord, in your good will toward Zion, so that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.

[[psalms-50-21]]
^21^ Then you will accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations, and holocausts. Then they will lay calves upon your altar.

[[psalms-51-1]]
^1^ Unto the end. The understanding of David.

[[psalms-51-2]]
^2^ When Doeg the Edomite came and reported to Saul, David went to the house of Ahimelech.

[[psalms-51-3]]
^3^ Why do you glory in malice, you who are powerful in iniquity?

[[psalms-51-4]]
^4^ All day long your tongue thinks up injustice. Like a sharp razor, you have wrought deceit.

[[psalms-51-5]]
^5^ You have loved malice above goodness, and iniquity more than speaking righteousness.

[[psalms-51-6]]
^6^ You have loved all precipitous words, you deceitful tongue.

[[psalms-51-7]]
^7^ Because of this, God will destroy you in the end. He will pull you up, and he will remove you from your tabernacle and your root from the land of the living.

[[psalms-51-8]]
^8^ The just will see and be afraid, and they will laugh over him, and say:

[[psalms-51-9]]
^9^ “Behold the man who did not set God as his helper. But he hoped in the multitude of his riches, and so he prevailed in his emptiness.”

[[psalms-51-10]]
^10^ But I, like a fruitful olive tree in the house of God, have hoped in the mercy of God unto eternity, and forever and ever.

[[psalms-51-11]]
^11^ I will confess to you forever, because you have accomplished it. And I will wait on your name, for it is good in the sight of your saints.


[[psalms-52]]
== Chapter 52

[[psalms-52-1]]
^1^ Unto the end. For Mahalath: the thoughts of David. The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”

[[psalms-52-2]]
^2^ They were corrupted, and they became abominable with iniquities. There is no one who does good.

[[psalms-52-3]]
^3^ God gazed down from heaven on the sons of men, to see if there were any who were considering or seeking God.

[[psalms-52-4]]
^4^ All have gone astray; together they have become useless. There is no one who does good; there is not even one.

[[psalms-52-5]]
^5^ Will they never learn: all those who work iniquity, who devour my people like a meal of bread?

[[psalms-52-6]]
^6^ They have not called upon God. In that place, they have trembled in fear, where there was no fear. For God has scattered the bones of those who please men. They have been confounded, because God has spurned them.

[[psalms-52-7]]
^7^ Who will grant from Zion the salvation of Israel? Jacob will exult, when God will convert the captivity of his people; and Israel will rejoice.


[[psalms-53]]

^2^ when the Ziphites had arrived and they said to Saul, “Has not David been hidden with us?”

[[psalms-53-3]]
^3^ Save me, O God, by your name, and judge me in your virtue.

[[psalms-53-4]]
^4^ O God, listen to my prayer. Pay attention to the words of my mouth.

[[psalms-53-5]]
^5^ For strangers have risen up against me, and the strong have sought my soul. And they have not set God before their eyes.

[[psalms-53-6]]
^6^ For behold, God is my helper, and the Lord is the protector of my soul.

[[psalms-53-7]]
^7^ Turn back the evils upon my adversaries, and ruin them by your truth.

[[psalms-53-8]]
^8^ I will freely sacrifice to you, and I will confess your name, O God, because it is good.

[[psalms-53-9]]
^9^ For you have quickly rescued me from all tribulation, and my eye has looked down upon my enemies.

 (55)
[[psalms-54-1]]
^1^ Unto the end. In verses, the understanding of David.

[[psalms-54-2]]
^2^ Listen to my prayer, O God, and despise not my supplication.

[[psalms-54-3]]
^3^ Be attentive to me, and heed me. I have been grieved in my training, and I have been disturbed

[[psalms-54-4]]
^4^ at the voice of the adversary and at the tribulation of the sinner. For they have diverted iniquities toward me, and they have been harassing me with rage.

[[psalms-54-5]]
^5^ My heart has become disturbed within me, and the dread of death has fallen over me.

[[psalms-54-6]]
^6^ Fear and trembling have overwhelmed me, and darkness has buried me.

[[psalms-54-7]]
^7^ And I said, “Who will give me wings like the dove, so that I may fly away and take rest?”

[[psalms-54-8]]
^8^ Behold, I have fled far away, and I linger in solitude.

[[psalms-54-9]]
^9^ I waited for him who saved me from a weak-minded spirit and from a tempest.

[[psalms-54-10]]
^10^ Cast them down, O Lord, and divide their tongues. For I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.

[[psalms-54-11]]
^11^ Day and night, iniquity will surround it upon its walls, and hardship is in its midst,

[[psalms-54-12]]
^12^ with injustice. And usury and deceit have not fallen away from its streets.

[[psalms-54-13]]
^13^ For if my enemy had spoken evil about me, certainly, I would have sustained it. And if he who hated me had been speaking great things against me, I would perhaps have hidden myself from him.

[[psalms-54-14]]
^14^ Truly, you are a man of one mind: my leader and my acquaintance,

[[psalms-54-15]]
^15^ who took sweet food together with me. In the house of God, we walked side-by-side.

[[psalms-54-16]]
^16^ Let death come upon them, and let them descend alive into Hellfire. For there is wickedness in their dwellings, in their midst.

[[psalms-54-17]]
^17^ But I have cried out to God, and the Lord will save me.

[[psalms-54-18]]
^18^ Evening and morning and midday, I will discourse and announce, and he will heed my voice.

[[psalms-54-19]]
^19^ He will redeem my soul in peace from those who draw near to me. For, among the many, they were with me.

[[psalms-54-20]]
^20^ God will hear, and He who is before time will humble them. For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God.

[[psalms-54-21]]
^21^ He has stretched forth his hand in retribution. They have contaminated his covenant.

[[psalms-54-22]]
^22^ They were divided by the wrath of his countenance, and his heart has drawn near. His words are smoother than oil, and they are arrows.

[[psalms-54-23]]
^23^ Cast your cares upon the Lord, and he will nurture you. He will not allow the just to be tossed about forever.

[[psalms-54-24]]
^24^ Truly, O God, you will lead them away into the well of death. Bloody and deceitful men will not divide their days in half. But I will hope in you, O Lord.


[[psalms-55]]
== Chapter 55
 (56)
[[psalms-55-1]]
^1^ Unto the end. For the people who have become far removed from the Sacred. Of David, with the inscription of a title, when the Philistines held him in Gath.

[[psalms-55-2]]
^2^ Have mercy on me, O God, because man has trampled over me. All day long, he has afflicted me by fighting against me.

[[psalms-55-3]]
^3^ My enemies have trampled over me all day long. For those who make war against me are many.

[[psalms-55-4]]
^4^ From the height of the day, I will be afraid. But truly, I will hope in you.

[[psalms-55-5]]
^5^ In God, I will praise my words. In God, I have put my trust. I will not fear what flesh can do to me.

[[psalms-55-6]]
^6^ All day long, they curse my words. All their intentions are for evil against me.

[[psalms-55-7]]
^7^ They will dwell and hide themselves. They will watch my heel, just as they waited for my soul;

[[psalms-55-8]]
^8^ because of this, nothing will save them. In your anger, you will crush the people.

[[psalms-55-9]]
^9^ O God, I have announced my life to you. You have placed my tears in your sight, and even in your promise.

[[psalms-55-10]]
^10^ Then my enemies will be turned back. On whatever day that I call upon you, behold, I know that you are my God.

[[psalms-55-11]]
^11^ In God, I will praise the word. In the Lord, I will praise his speech. In God, I have hoped. I will not fear what man can do to me.

[[psalms-55-12]]
^12^ My vows to you, O God, are in me. I will repay them. Praises be to you.

[[psalms-55-13]]
^13^ For you have rescued my soul from death and my feet from slipping, so that I may be pleasing in the sight of God, in the light of the living.

[[psalms-56-2]]
^2^ Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me. For my soul trusts in you. And I will hope in the shadow of your wings, until iniquity passes away.

[[psalms-56-3]]
^3^ I will cry out to God Most High, to God who has been kind to me.

[[psalms-56-4]]
^4^ He sent from heaven and freed me. He has surrendered into disgrace those who trampled me. God has sent his mercy and his truth.

[[psalms-56-5]]
^5^ And he has rescued my soul from the midst of the young lions. I slept troubled. The sons of men: their teeth are weapons and arrows, and their tongue is a sharp sword.

[[psalms-56-6]]
^6^ Be exalted above the heavens, O God, and your glory above all the earth.

[[psalms-56-7]]
^7^ They prepared a snare for my feet, and they bowed down my soul. They dug a pit before my face, yet they have fallen into it.

[[psalms-56-8]]
^8^ My heart is prepared, O God, my heart is prepared. I will sing, and I will compose a psalm.

[[psalms-56-9]]
^9^ Rise up, my glory. Rise up, psaltery and harp. I will arise in early morning.

[[psalms-56-10]]
^10^ I will confess to you, O Lord, among the peoples. I will compose a psalm to you among the nations.

[[psalms-56-11]]
^11^ For your mercy has been magnified, even to the heavens, and your truth, even to the clouds.

[[psalms-57-2]]
^2^ If, truly and certainly, you speak justice, then judge what is right, you sons of men.

[[psalms-57-3]]
^3^ For, even in your heart, you work iniquity. Your hands construct injustice on the earth.

[[psalms-57-4]]
^4^ Sinners have become foreigners from the womb; they have gone astray from conception. They have been speaking falsehoods.

[[psalms-57-5]]
^5^ Their fury is similar to that of a serpent; it is like a deaf asp, who even blocks her ears,

[[psalms-57-6]]
^6^ who will not listen to the voice of charmers, nor even to the enchanter who chants wisely.

[[psalms-57-7]]
^7^ God will crush their teeth within their own mouth. The Lord will break the molars of the lions.

[[psalms-57-8]]
^8^ They will come to nothing, like water flowing away. He has aimed his bow, while they are being weakened.

^9^ Like wax that flows, they will be carried away. Fire has fallen upon them, and they will not see the sun.

^10^ Before your thorns could know the brier, he consumes them alive, as if in rage.

[[psalms-57-11]]

[[psalms-58-6]]
^6^ Rise up to meet me, and see: even you, O Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel. Reach out to visit all nations. Do not take pity on all those who work iniquity.

^7^ They will return toward evening, and they will suffer hunger like dogs, and they will wander around the city.

^8^ Behold, they will speak with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips: “For who has heard us?”

^11^ My God, his mercy will precede me.

[[psalms-58-13]]
^13^ by the offense of their mouth and by the speech of their lips. And may they be caught in their arrogance. And, for their cursing and lying, they will be made known

[[psalms-58-14]]
^14^ at the consummation, in the fury of the consummation, and so they will be no more. And they will know that God will rule over Jacob, even to the ends of the earth.

[[psalms-58-15]]
^15^ They will return toward evening, and they will suffer hunger like dogs, and they will wander around the city.

[[psalms-58-16]]
^16^ They will be dispersed in order to gnaw, and truly, when they will not have been satisfied, they will murmur.

[[psalms-58-17]]
^17^ But I will sing your strength, and I will extol your mercy, in the morning. For you have been my supporter and my refuge in the day of my tribulation.

^3^ O God, you have rejected us, and you have ruined us. You became angry, and yet you have been merciful to us.

[[psalms-59-4]]
^4^ You have moved the earth, and you have disturbed it. Heal its breaches, for it has been moved.

[[psalms-59-5]]
^5^ You have revealed to your people difficulties. You have made us drink the wine of remorse.

[[psalms-59-6]]
^6^ You have given a warning sign to those who fear you, so that they may flee from before the face of the bow, so that your beloved may be delivered.

[[psalms-59-7]]
^7^ Save me with your right hand, and hear me.

^8^ God has spoken in his holy place: I will rejoice, and I will divide Shechem, and I will measure the steep valley of the tabernacles.

^9^ Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine. And Ephraim is the strength of my head. Judah is my king.

[[psalms-59-10]]
^10^ Moab is the cooking pot of my hope. Into Idumea, I will extend my shoe. To me, the foreigners have been made subject.

[[psalms-59-11]]
^11^ Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will lead me all the way to Idumea?

[[psalms-59-12]]
^12^ Will not you, O God, who has rejected us? And will not you, O God, go out with our armies?

[[psalms-60-4]]
^4^ for you have been my hope, a tower of strength before the face of the enemy.

[[psalms-60-5]]
^5^ I will dwell in your tabernacle forever. I will be protected under the cover of your wings.

[[psalms-61-2]]
^2^ Will my soul not be subject to God? For from him is my salvation.

[[psalms-61-3]]
^3^ Yes, he himself is my God and my salvation. He is my supporter; I will be moved no more.

[[psalms-61-4]]
^4^ How is it that you rush against a man? Every one of you puts to death, as if you were pulling down a ruined wall, leaning over and falling apart.

[[psalms-61-5]]
^5^ So, truly, they intended to reject my price. I ran in thirst. They blessed with their mouth and cursed with their heart.

[[psalms-61-6]]
^6^ Yet, truly, my soul will be subject to God. For from him is my patience.

[[psalms-61-7]]
^7^ For he is my God and my Savior. He is my helper; I will not be expelled.

[[psalms-61-8]]
^8^ In God is my salvation and my glory. He is the God of my help, and my hope is in God.

[[psalms-61-9]]
^9^ All peoples gathered together: trust in him. Pour out your hearts in his sight. God is our helper for eternity.

[[psalms-61-10]]
^10^ So, truly, the sons of men are untrustworthy. The sons of men are liars in the scales, so that, by emptiness, they may deceive among themselves.

[[psalms-61-11]]
^11^ Do not trust in iniquity, and do not desire plunder. If riches flow toward you, do not be willing to set your heart on them.

[[psalms-61-12]]
^12^ God has spoken once. I have heard two things: that power belongs to God,

[[psalms-61-13]]

^5^ So will I bless you in my life, and I will lift up my hands in your name.

^6^ Let my soul be filled, as if with marrow and fatness; and my mouth will give praise with exultant lips.

^7^ When I have remembered you on my bed in the morning, I will meditate on you.

[[psalms-62-8]]

[[psalms-62-9]]
^9^ My soul has clung close to you. Your right hand has supported me.

[[psalms-63-6]]

[[psalms-63-7]]
^7^ They have been searching carefully for iniquities. Their exhaustive search has failed. Man will approach with a deep heart,

[[psalms-63-8]]
^8^ and God will be exalted. The arrows of the little ones have become their wounds,

[[psalms-63-9]]
^9^ and their tongues have been weakened against them. All those who saw them have been troubled;

[[psalms-63-10]]
^10^ and every man was afraid. And they announced the works of God, and they understood his acts.

[[psalms-63-11]]

^13^ I will enter your house with holocausts. I will repay my vows to you,

[[psalms-65-14]]
^14^ which my lips discerned and my mouth spoke, in my tribulation.

[[psalms-65-15]]

[[psalms-65-18]]

^4^ I have endured hardships, while crying out. My jaws have become hoarse; my eyes have failed. Meanwhile, I hope in my God.

[[psalms-68-5]]
^5^ Those who hate me without cause have been multiplied beyond the hairs of my head. My enemies, who persecuted me unjustly, have been strengthened. Then I was required to pay for what I did not take.

^6^ O God, you know my foolishness, and my offenses have not been hidden from you.

[[psalms-68-7]]
^7^ Let those who wait for you, O Lord, the Lord of hosts, not be shamed in me. Let those who seek you, O God of Israel, not be confounded over me.

[[psalms-68-9]]
^9^ I have become a stranger to my brothers and a sojourner to the sons of my mother.

^13^ Those who sat at the gate spoke against me, and those who drank wine made me their song.

[[psalms-68-14]]
^14^ But as for me, truly, my prayer is to you, O Lord. This time has pleased you well, O God. In the multitude of your mercy, in the truth of your salvation, hear me.

[[psalms-68-15]]
^15^ Rescue me from the quagmire, so that I may not become trapped. Free me from those who hate me and from deep waters.

[[psalms-68-16]]
^16^ Do not allow the tempest of water to submerge me, nor the deep to absorb me. And do not allow the well to close in on me.

[[psalms-68-17]]
^17^ Hear me, O Lord, for your mercy is kind. Look upon me, according to the fullness of your compassion.

[[psalms-68-20]]
^20^ You know my reproach, and my confusion, and my reverence.

[[psalms-68-21]]
^21^ All those who trouble me are in your sight; my heart has anticipated reproach and misery. And I sought for one who might grieve together with me, but there was no one, and for one who might console me, and I found no one.

[[psalms-68-22]]
^22^ And they gave me gall for my food. And in my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.

[[psalms-68-23]]
^23^ Let their table be a snare before them, and a retribution, and a scandal.

[[psalms-68-24]]
^24^ Let their eyes be darkened, so that they may not see, and may their back always be crooked.

[[psalms-68-25]]
^25^ Pour out your indignation upon them, and may the fury of your anger take hold of them.

[[psalms-68-26]]
^26^ May their dwelling place be deserted, and may there be no one who dwells in their tabernacles.

[[psalms-68-27]]
^27^ For they persecuted whomever you struck. And they have added to the grief of my wounds.

[[psalms-68-28]]
^28^ Assign an iniquity upon their iniquity, and may they not enter into your justice.

[[psalms-68-29]]
^29^ Delete them from the Book of the Living, and let them not be written down with the just.

[[psalms-68-30]]
^30^ I am poor and sorrowful, but your salvation, O God, has taken me up.

[[psalms-68-31]]
^31^ I will praise the name of God with a canticle, and I will magnify him with praise.

[[psalms-68-32]]
^32^ And it will please God more than a new calf producing horns and hoofs.

[[psalms-68-33]]
^33^ Let the poor see and rejoice. Seek God, and your soul will live.

[[psalms-68-34]]
^34^ For the Lord has heard the poor, and he has not despised his prisoners.

[[psalms-68-35]]
^35^ Let the heavens and the earth praise him: the sea, and everything that crawls in it.

[[psalms-68-36]]

[[psalms-70-11]]

[[psalms-70-12]]
^12^ O God, do not be far from me. O my God, provide for my assistance.

[[psalms-70-13]]

[[psalms-70-19]]
^19^ and your justice, O God, even to the highest great things that you have done. O God, who is like you?

[[psalms-70-20]]
^20^ How great is the tribulation that you have revealed to me: very great and evil. And so, turning back, you have brought me to life, and you have led me back again from the abyss of the earth.

[[psalms-72-2]]

[[psalms-72-3]]
^3^ For I was zealous over the iniquitous, seeing the peacefulness of sinners.

^4^ For they have no respect for their death, nor do they have support in their wounds.

[[psalms-72-5]]
^5^ They are not with the hardships of men, nor will they be scourged with men.

[[psalms-72-6]]
^6^ Therefore, arrogance has held on to them. They have been covered with their iniquity and impiety.

[[psalms-72-7]]
^7^ Their iniquity has proceeded, as if from fat. They have parted from the affection of the heart.

[[psalms-72-8]]
^8^ They have thought and spoken wickedness. They have spoken iniquity in high places.

[[psalms-72-9]]
^9^ They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue has traversed the earth.

^13^ And I said: So then, it is without purpose that I have justified my heart and washed my hands among the innocent.

[[psalms-72-14]]
^14^ And I have been scourged all day long, and I have received my chastisement in the mornings.

[[psalms-72-15]]
^15^ If I were to say that I would explain this: Behold, I would condemn this nation of your sons.

[[psalms-72-16]]
^16^ I considered, so that I might know this. It is a hardship before me,

^17^ until I may enter into the Sanctuary of God, and understand it to its last part.

[[psalms-72-20]]

[[psalms-72-23]]
^23^ I have become like a beast of burden to you, and I am always with you.

[[psalms-72-24]]
^24^ You have held my right hand. And in your will, you have conducted me, and with your glory, you have taken me up.

[[psalms-72-25]]
^25^ For what is there for me in heaven? And what do I wish for on earth before you?

[[psalms-72-26]]
^26^ My body has failed, and my heart: O God of my heart, and God my portion, into eternity.

[[psalms-72-27]]
^27^ For behold, those who put themselves far from you will perish. You have perished all those who fornicate away from you.

[[psalms-72-28]]
^28^ But it is good for me to adhere to God, to put my hope in the Lord God, so that I may announce all your prophecies, at the gates of the daughter of Zion.

[[psalms-73-1]]
^1^ The understanding of Asaph. O God, why have you rejected us to the end. Why has your fury become enraged over the sheep of your pasture?

[[psalms-73-2]]
^2^ Be mindful of your congregation, which you have possessed from the beginning. You redeemed the scepter of your inheritance, mount Zion, in which you have dwelt.

[[psalms-73-3]]
^3^ Lift up your hands against their arrogance in the end. How great the malice of the enemy has been in the sanctuary!

[[psalms-73-4]]
^4^ And those who hate you have been glorified, in the midst of your solemnity. They have set up their own signs as a proof,

[[psalms-73-5]]
^5^ as if it had been issued from on high; yet they did not understand. As in a forest of chopped wood,

[[psalms-73-6]]
^6^ they have cut down the entrances themselves. With axe and hatchet, they have brought it down.

[[psalms-73-7]]
^7^ They have set fire to your Sanctuary. They have polluted the tabernacle of your name on earth.

[[psalms-73-8]]
^8^ They have said in their heart, the whole group of them together: “Let us cause all the feast days of God to cease from the land.

[[psalms-73-9]]
^9^ We have not seen our proof; there is now no prophet. And he will no longer know us.”

[[psalms-73-10]]
^10^ How long, O God, will the enemy place blame? Is the adversary to provoke your name until the end?

[[psalms-73-11]]
^11^ Why do you turn your hand away, even your right hand, from the midst of your sinews, until the end?

[[psalms-73-12]]
^12^ But God is our king before all ages. He has wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.

[[psalms-73-13]]
^13^ In your virtue, you confirmed the sea. You crushed the heads of the serpents in the waters.

[[psalms-73-14]]
^14^ You have broken the heads of the serpent. You have given him as food for the people of the Ethiopians.

[[psalms-73-15]]
^15^ You have disrupted the fountains and the torrents. You have dried up the rivers of Ethan.

[[psalms-73-16]]
^16^ Yours is the day, and yours is the night. You have made the morning light and the sun.

[[psalms-73-17]]
^17^ You have made all the limits of the earth. The summer and the spring were formed by you.

[[psalms-73-18]]
^18^ Be mindful of this: the enemy placed blame against the Lord, and a foolish people has incited against your name.

[[psalms-73-19]]
^19^ Do not hand over to beasts the souls that confess to you; and do not forget the souls of your poor until the end.

[[psalms-73-20]]
^20^ Consider your covenant. For those who have been darkened upon the earth have been filled by the iniquity of the houses.

[[psalms-73-21]]
^21^ Do not allow the humble to be turned away in confusion. The poor and the needy will praise your name.

[[psalms-73-22]]
^22^ Rise up, O God, judge your own case. Call to mind the accusations against you, which are made by the foolish all day long.

[[psalms-73-23]]
^23^ Do not forget the voices of your adversaries. The arrogance of those who hate you rises up continually.

^1^ Unto the end. May you not be corrupted. A Canticle Psalm of Asaph.

[[psalms-74-2]]
^2^ We will confess to you, O God. We will confess, and we will call upon your name. We will describe your wonders.

[[psalms-74-3]]
^3^ While I have time, I will judge justices.

[[psalms-74-4]]
^4^ The earth has been dissolved, with all who dwell in it. I have confirmed its pillars.

[[psalms-74-5]]
^5^ I said to the iniquitous: “Do not act unjustly,” and to the offenders: “Do not exalt the horn.”

[[psalms-74-6]]
^6^ Do not exalt your horn on high. Do not speak iniquity against God.

[[psalms-74-7]]
^7^ For it is neither from the east, nor from the west, nor before the desert mountains.

[[psalms-74-8]]
^8^ For God is judge. This one he humbles and that one he exalts.

[[psalms-74-9]]
^9^ For, in the hand of the Lord, there is a cup of undiluted wine, full of consternation. And he has tipped it from here to there. So, truly, its dregs have not been emptied. All the sinners of the earth will drink.

[[psalms-74-10]]
^10^ But I will announce it in every age. I will sing to the God of Jacob.

[[psalms-74-11]]
^11^ And I will break all the horns of sinners. And the horns of the just will be exalted.

[[psalms-75-1]]
^1^ Unto the end. With Praises. A Psalm of Asaph. A Canticle to the Assyrians.

[[psalms-75-2]]
^2^ In Judea, God is known. In Israel, his name is great.

[[psalms-75-3]]
^3^ And his place has been formed with peace. And his dwelling place is in Zion.

[[psalms-75-4]]
^4^ In that place, he has broken the powers of the bows, the shield, the sword, and the battle.

[[psalms-75-5]]
^5^ You illuminate wondrously from the mountains of eternity.

[[psalms-75-6]]
^6^ All the foolish of heart have been disturbed. They have slept their sleep, and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.

[[psalms-75-7]]
^7^ At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, those who were mounted on horseback have fallen asleep.

[[psalms-75-8]]
^8^ You are terrible, and so, who can withstand you? From thence is your wrath.

[[psalms-75-9]]
^9^ You have caused judgment to be heard from heaven. The earth trembled and was quieted,

[[psalms-75-10]]
^10^ when God rose up in judgment in order to bring salvation to all the meek of the earth.

[[psalms-75-11]]
^11^ For the thinking of man will confess to you, and the legacy of his thinking will keep a feast day to you.

[[psalms-75-12]]
^12^ Make vows and pay them to the Lord, your God. All you who surround him bring gifts: to him who is terrible,

[[psalms-75-13]]
^13^ even to him who takes away the spirit of leaders, to him who is terrible with the kings of the earth.

[[psalms-76-1]]
^1^ Unto the end. For Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.

[[psalms-76-2]]
^2^ I cried out to the Lord with my voice, to God with my voice, and he attended to me.

[[psalms-76-3]]
^3^ In the days of my tribulation, I sought God, with my hands opposite him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be consoled.

[[psalms-76-4]]
^4^ I was mindful of God, and I was delighted, and I was distressed, and my spirit fell away.

[[psalms-76-5]]
^5^ My eyes anticipated the vigils. I was disturbed, and I did not speak.

[[psalms-76-6]]
^6^ I considered the days of antiquity, and I held the years of eternity in my mind.

[[psalms-76-7]]
^7^ And I meditated in the night with my heart, and I was distressed, and I examined my spirit.

[[psalms-76-8]]
^8^ So then, will God reject for eternity? Will he not continue to allow himself to show favor?

[[psalms-76-9]]
^9^ Or, will he cut off his mercy in the end, from generation to generation?

[[psalms-76-10]]
^10^ And would God ever forget to be merciful? Or, would he, in his wrath, restrict his mercies?

[[psalms-76-11]]
^11^ And I said, “Now I have begun. This change is from the right hand of the Most High.”

[[psalms-76-12]]
^12^ I was mindful of the works of the Lord. For I will be mindful from the beginning of your wonders,

[[psalms-76-13]]
^13^ and I will meditate on all your works. And I will take part in your intentions.

[[psalms-76-14]]
^14^ Your way, O God, is in what is holy. Which God is great like our God?

[[psalms-76-15]]
^15^ You are the God who performs miracles. You have made your virtue known among the peoples.

[[psalms-76-16]]
^16^ With your arm, you have redeemed your people, the sons of Jacob and of Joseph.

[[psalms-76-17]]
^17^ The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you, and they were afraid, and the depths were stirred up.

[[psalms-76-18]]
^18^ Great was the sound of the waters. The clouds uttered a voice. For your arrows also pass by.

[[psalms-76-19]]
^19^ The voice of your thunder is like a wheel. Your flashes have illuminated the whole world. The earth has quaked and trembled.

[[psalms-76-20]]
^20^ Your way is through the sea, and your paths are through many waters. And your traces will not be known.

[[psalms-76-21]]
^21^ You have conducted your people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.


[[psalms-77]]

 (78)
[[psalms-77-1]]
^1^ The understanding of Asaph. O my people, attend to my law. Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

[[psalms-77-2]]
^2^ I will open my mouth in parables. I will speak about concepts that are from the beginning.

[[psalms-77-3]]
^3^ We have heard and known such great things, as our fathers have described to us.

[[psalms-77-4]]
^4^ These things have not been hidden from their sons in any generation: declaring the praises of the Lord, and his virtues, and the wonders that he has done.

[[psalms-77-5]]
^5^ And he has received testimony with Jacob, and he has set a law within Israel. Such great things, he has commanded our fathers, so as to make these things known to their sons,

[[psalms-77-6]]
^6^ so that another generation might know them, and so that the sons, who will be born and who will grow up, shall describe them to their sons.

[[psalms-77-7]]
^7^ So then, may they put their hope in God, and may they not forget the works of God, and may they seek his commandments.

[[psalms-77-8]]
^8^ May they not become like their fathers, a perverse and exasperating generation: a generation that does not straighten their heart and whose spirit is not trustworthy with God.

[[psalms-77-9]]
^9^ The sons of Ephraim, who bend and shoot the bow, have been turned back in the day of battle.

[[psalms-77-10]]
^10^ They have not kept the covenant of God. And they were not willing to walk in his law.

[[psalms-77-11]]
^11^ And they have been forgetful of his benefits, and of his miracle, which he revealed to them.

[[psalms-77-12]]
^12^ He performed miracles in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis.

[[psalms-77-13]]
^13^ He broke the sea and he led them through. And he stationed the waters, as if in a vessel.

[[psalms-77-14]]
^14^ And he led them with a cloud by day, and with illumination by fire throughout the night.

[[psalms-77-15]]
^15^ He broke through the rock in the wasteland, and he gave them to drink, as if from the great abyss.

[[psalms-77-16]]
^16^ He brought forth water from the rock, and he conducted the waters, as if they were rivers.

[[psalms-77-17]]
^17^ And yet, they continued to sin against him. In a waterless place, they provoked the Most High with resentment.

[[psalms-77-18]]
^18^ And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking for food according to their desires.

[[psalms-77-19]]
^19^ And they spoke badly about God. They said, “Would God be able to prepare a table in the desert?

[[psalms-77-20]]
^20^ He struck the rock, and so waters flowed and the torrents flooded, but would even he be able to provide bread, or provide a table, for his people?”

[[psalms-77-21]]
^21^ Therefore, the Lord heard, and he was dismayed, and a fire was kindled within Jacob, and an anger ascended into Israel.

[[psalms-77-22]]
^22^ For they neither put their trust in God, nor did they hope in his salvation.

[[psalms-77-23]]
^23^ And he commanded the clouds from above, and he opened the doors of heaven.

[[psalms-77-24]]
^24^ And he rained down manna upon them to eat, and he gave them the bread of heaven.

[[psalms-77-25]]
^25^ Man ate the bread of Angels. He sent them provisions in abundance.

[[psalms-77-26]]
^26^ He transferred the south wind from heaven, and, in his virtue, he brought in the Southwest wind.

[[psalms-77-27]]
^27^ And he rained down flesh upon them, as if it were dust, and feathered birds, as if they were the sand of the sea.

[[psalms-77-28]]
^28^ And they fell down in the midst of their camp, encircling their tabernacles.

[[psalms-77-29]]
^29^ And they ate until they were greatly satisfied, and he brought to them according to their desires.

[[psalms-77-30]]
^30^ They were not cheated out of what they wanted. Their food was still in their mouth,

[[psalms-77-31]]
^31^ and then the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones among them, and he impeded the elect of Israel.

[[psalms-77-32]]
^32^ In all these things, they continued to sin, and they were not trustworthy with his miracles.

[[psalms-77-33]]
^33^ And their days faded away into vanity, and their years with haste.

[[psalms-77-34]]
^34^ When he slew them, then they sought him. And they returned, and they drew near to him in the early morning.

[[psalms-77-35]]
^35^ And they were mindful that God is their helper and that the Most High God is their redeemer.

[[psalms-77-36]]
^36^ And they chose him with their mouth, and then they lied to him with their tongue.

[[psalms-77-37]]
^37^ For their heart was not upright with him, nor have they been living faithfully in his covenant.

[[psalms-77-38]]
^38^ Yet he is merciful, and he will pardon their sins. And he will not destroy them. And he has abundantly turned aside his own wrath. And he did not enflame his wrath entirely.

[[psalms-77-39]]
^39^ And he remembered that they are flesh: with a spirit that goes forth and does not return.

[[psalms-77-40]]
^40^ How often did they provoke him in the desert and stir him to wrath in a waterless place?

[[psalms-77-41]]
^41^ And they turned back and tempted God, and they exasperated the Holy One of Israel.

[[psalms-77-42]]
^42^ They did not remember his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of the one troubling them.

[[psalms-77-43]]
^43^ Thus, he positioned his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the field of Tanis.

[[psalms-77-44]]
^44^ And he turned their rivers into blood, along with their rain showers, so that they could not drink.

[[psalms-77-45]]
^45^ He sent among them the common fly, and it devoured them, and the frog, and it scattered them.

[[psalms-77-46]]
^46^ And he gave up their fruits to mold and their labors to the locust.

[[psalms-77-47]]
^47^ And he slew their vineyards with hail and their mulberry trees with severe frost.

[[psalms-77-48]]
^48^ And he delivered their cattle to the hail and their possessions to fire.

[[psalms-77-49]]
^49^ And he sent the wrath of his indignation among them: indignation and wrath and tribulation, sent forth by evil angels.

[[psalms-77-50]]
^50^ He made way for the path of his anger. He did not spare their souls from death. And he enclosed their beasts of burden in death.

[[psalms-77-51]]
^51^ And he struck all the first-born in the land of Egypt: the first-fruits of all their labor in the tabernacles of Ham.

[[psalms-77-52]]
^52^ And he took away his own people like sheep, and he led them through the wilderness like a flock.

[[psalms-77-53]]
^53^ And he led them out in hope, and they did not fear. And the sea covered their enemies.

[[psalms-77-54]]
^54^ And he led them to the mountain of his sanctification: the mountain that his right hand had acquired. And he cast out the Gentiles before their face. And he divided their land by lot to them, with a line of distribution.

[[psalms-77-55]]
^55^ And he caused the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.

[[psalms-77-56]]
^56^ Yet they tempted and aggravated God Most High, and they did not keep his testaments.

[[psalms-77-57]]
^57^ And they turned themselves aside, and they did not serve the covenant. In the same manner as their fathers, they were turned backwards, like a crooked bow.

[[psalms-77-58]]
^58^ They impelled him to anger on their hills, and they provoked him to rivalry with their graven images.

[[psalms-77-59]]
^59^ God listened, and he spurned them, and he reduced Israel greatly, almost to nothing.

[[psalms-77-60]]
^60^ And he rejected the tabernacle of Shiloh, his tabernacle where he had dwelt among men.

[[psalms-77-61]]
^61^ And he delivered their virtue into captivity, and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.

[[psalms-77-62]]
^62^ And he enclosed his people with the sword, and he spurned his inheritance.

[[psalms-77-63]]
^63^ Fire consumed their young men, and their virgins were not lamented.

[[psalms-77-64]]
^64^ Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows did not weep.

[[psalms-77-65]]
^65^ And the Lord was awakened, as if out of sleep, and like a powerful man impaired by wine.

[[psalms-77-66]]
^66^ And he struck his enemies on the back. He gave them over to everlasting disgrace.

[[psalms-77-67]]
^67^ And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.

[[psalms-77-68]]
^68^ But he chose the tribe of Judah: mount Zion, which he loved.

[[psalms-77-69]]
^69^ And he built up his sanctuary, like a single-horned beast, in the land that he founded for all ages.

[[psalms-77-70]]
^70^ And he chose his servant David, and he took him from the flocks of the sheep: he received him from following the ewes with their young,

[[psalms-77-71]]
^71^ in order to pasture Jacob his servant and Israel his inheritance.

[[psalms-77-72]]
^72^ And he fed them with the innocence of his heart. And he led them with the understanding of his hands.

[[psalms-78-2]]
^2^ They have placed the dead bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints for the beasts of the earth.

[[psalms-78-3]]
^3^ They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one who would bury them.

[[psalms-78-4]]
^4^ We have become a disgrace to our neighbors, an object of ridicule and mockery to those who are around us.

[[psalms-78-5]]
^5^ How long, O Lord? Will you be angry until the end? Will your zeal be kindled like a fire?

[[psalms-78-6]]
^6^ Pour out your wrath among the Gentiles, who have not known you, and upon the kingdoms that have not invoked your name.

[[psalms-78-7]]
^7^ For they have devoured Jacob, and they have desolated his place.

[[psalms-78-8]]
^8^ Do not remember our iniquities of the past. May your mercies quickly intercept us, for we have become exceedingly poor.

[[psalms-78-9]]
^9^ Help us, O God, our Savior. And free us, Lord, for the glory of your name. And forgive us our sins for the sake of your name.

[[psalms-78-10]]
^10^ Let them not say among the Gentiles, “Where is their God?” And may your name become known among the nations before our eyes. For the retribution of your servants’ blood, which has been poured out:

[[psalms-78-11]]
^11^ may the groans of the shackled enter before you. According to the greatness of your arm, take possession of the sons of those who have been killed.

[[psalms-78-12]]
^12^ And repay our neighbors sevenfold within their sinews. It is the reproach of the same ones who brought reproach against you, O Lord.

^5^ O Lord, God of hosts, how long will you be angry over the prayer of your servant?

^8^ O God of hosts, convert us. And reveal your face, and we will be saved.

^9^ You have transferred a vineyard from Egypt. You have cast out the Gentiles, and planted it.

[[psalms-79-10]]
^10^ You were the leader of the journey in its sight. You planted its roots, and it filled the earth.

[[psalms-79-11]]
^11^ Its shadow covered the hills, and its branches covered the cedars of God.

[[psalms-79-12]]
^12^ It extended its new branches even to the sea, and its new seedlings even to the river.

[[psalms-79-13]]
^13^ So then, why have you destroyed its walls, so that all those who pass by the way gather its grapes?

[[psalms-79-14]]
^14^ The wild boar of the forest has trampled it, and a single wild beast has laid waste to it.

[[psalms-79-15]]
^15^ Turn back, O God of hosts. Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vineyard;

[[psalms-79-16]]

^4^ Sound the trumpet at the new moon, on the noteworthy day of your solemnity,

^7^ He turned the burdens away from his back. His hands had been a slave to baskets.

[[psalms-80-8]]
^8^ You called upon me in tribulation, and I freed you. I heard you within the hidden tempest. I tested you with waters of contradiction.

[[psalms-80-9]]
^9^ My people, listen and I will call you to testify. If, O Israel, you will pay heed to me,

[[psalms-80-10]]
^10^ then there will be no new god among you, nor will you adore a foreign god.

[[psalms-80-11]]
^11^ For I am the Lord your God, who led you out of the land of Egypt. Widen your mouth, and I will fill it.

[[psalms-80-12]]
^12^ But my people did not hear my voice, and Israel was not attentive to me.

[[psalms-80-13]]
^13^ And so, I sent them away, according to the desires of their heart. They will go forth according to their own inventions.

[[psalms-80-14]]
^14^ If my people had heard me, if Israel had walked in my ways,

[[psalms-80-15]]
^15^ I would have humbled their enemies, as if it were nothing, and I would have sent my hand upon those who troubled them.

[[psalms-82-6]]

[[psalms-82-7]]
^7^ the tabernacle of Edomites and Ishmaelites, and Moab and the Hagarites,

[[psalms-82-8]]
^8^ and Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, the foreigners among the inhabitants of Tyre.

^14^ My God, set them like a wheel, and like stubble before the face of the wind.

[[psalms-82-15]]
^15^ Set them like a fire burning up the forest, and like a flame burning up the mountains.

^16^ So will you pursue them in your tempest, and disturb them in your wrath.

[[psalms-82-17]]
^17^ Fill their faces with shame, and they will seek your name, O Lord.

^11^ For one day in your courts is better than thousands elsewhere. I have chosen to be lowly in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tabernacles of sinners.

[[psalms-83-12]]
^12^ For God loves mercy and truth. The Lord will give grace and glory.

[[psalms-87-4]]
^4^ For my soul has been filled with evils, and my life has drawn near to Hell.

[[psalms-87-5]]
^5^ I am considered to be among those who will descend into the pit. I have become like a man without assistance,

[[psalms-87-6]]
^6^ idle among the dead. I am like the wounded sleeping in sepulchers, whom you no longer remember, and who have been repelled by your hand.

[[psalms-87-7]]
^7^ They have lain me in the lower pit: in dark places and in the shadow of death.

[[psalms-87-8]]
^8^ Your fury has been confirmed over me. And you have brought all your waves upon me.

[[psalms-87-14]]
^14^ And I have cried out to you, O Lord, and in early morning, my prayer will come before you.

[[psalms-88-21]]
^21^ I have found my servant David. I have anointed him with my holy oil.

[[psalms-88-22]]
^22^ For my hand will assist him, and my arm will fortify him.

[[psalms-88-23]]
^23^ The enemy will have no advantage over him, nor will the son of iniquity be positioned to harm him.

[[psalms-88-24]]
^24^ And I will cut down his enemies before his face. And those who hate him, I will turn to flight.

[[psalms-88-25]]
^25^ And my truth and my mercy will be with him. And his horn will be exalted in my name.

[[psalms-88-26]]

^32^ if they profane my justices, and if they do not keep my commandments:

[[psalms-88-33]]
^33^ I will visit their iniquities with a rod, and their sins with a beating.

[[psalms-88-34]]
^34^ But I will not scatter my mercy from him, and I will not do harm to my truth.

[[psalms-88-35]]
^35^ And I will not profane my covenant, and I will not make void that which proceeds from my lips.

[[psalms-88-36]]
^36^ I have sworn by my holiness one time: I will not lie to David,

[[psalms-88-37]]
^37^ his offspring will remain for eternity. And his throne will be like the sun in my sight,

[[psalms-88-38]]
^38^ and, like the moon, it is perfected in eternity, and it is a faithful witness in heaven.

[[psalms-88-39]]
^39^ Yet, truly, you have rejected and despised, you have pushed away, my Christ.

^47^ How long, O Lord? Will you turn away unto the end? Will your wrath flare up like a fire?

^48^ Remember what my substance is. For could you really have appointed all the sons of men in vain?

[[psalms-88-49]]
^49^ Who is the man that will live, and yet not see death? Who will rescue his own soul from the hand of the underworld?

[[psalms-88-50]]
